Swift:
Playground- Seeing the changes real time without having to compile and executing.watching the value in a variable displayed on side bar
Huge community to help and grow together. Future language with Apple adding more features and updates soon.
Statically typed language- safe, relatively faster, but adopts easy and safety features from other languages like Python, C++, Scala
has to have a default switch case, bracekts in if else avoiding subtle errors
Generic Programming as in C++ templates. 

Iphone:
Elegance, Slick design, Pre installed high end apps, Security-no malwares/viruses, Support-Apple Store single place to
resort to making it easy.
Iphone betterment:
Siri- Intelligent assistant :
1. good thing- Hey siri- recognizing our voice even phone locked 6s dekhi suru vo 
2. siri has to be more intelligent. Google calendar schedule, traffic- Google assistant asks to leave early
